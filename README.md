# Student-Authentication-System
This system is for Student authentication, it shows how students activities is being carried out or manage.
 
**There are different segments to manage students.**

- Creating a database for Student.
- Track student's entry for a course.
- Add new student to database based on Admission (this feature will soon be added to the model).
- Remove old student from the database (remove from the faculty database not the school database) due to some offence.

## Create a Database for Student_authentication to CRUD necessary features.
**Create different tables for each feature, like:**
- courses (for each faculty).
   - Create table for Courses in each DEPARTMENT.
